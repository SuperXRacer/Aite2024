A Project made for the ImagineHack 2024 Hackathon in Taylor's University, made with "love" by Group Aite.

Didn't win anything, but still a decent project to have worked on.

- Bank customer service and advice is ASS, and no real changes have been made to the pre-meditated responses to CS questions
- We wanna change that with Aite AI
- Aite AI uses Google's Gemnini API, to act as a realtime ChatBot, prompted to give general financial advice.
- There are limits, as Gemini won't actually make investment recommendations or anything of the sort, but we hoped it still might help with decision making.
- The UI, while pretty, still has some bugs (Have some sympathy, made by first year CS students)
- Response speed varies depending on internet speed, don't blame us if your wifi is ass.
